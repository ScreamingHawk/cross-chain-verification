# Cross Chain Verification

Cross Chain Verification is an open-source tool designed to facilitate copying smart contract source verification from one Etherscan instance to another.

Quick example:

```bash
yarn verify -u https://api.etherscan.io/api -k XXX -a 0x0000000071727De22E5E9d8BAf0edAc6f37da032 -d https://api-sepolia.arbiscan.io/api -e XXX
```

## What’s the Deal, Bro?

Hey, you! Yeah, you, the one with the crypto shades and the moon-shaped tattoo. Ever felt like your smart contracts were lost in a cosmic maze? Fear not, because `Cross Chain Verification` is here to help! 🚀

## Features

**Cosmic Copy-Paste**: Our algorithm moonwalks through the crypto-verse, snatching smart contract code from one blockchain and flinging it onto another. It’s like trying to HODL a flaming NFT while riding a Shiba Inu blindfolded. Good luck, bro! 🌌🔥🚀

**Stellar Source Download**: Now, you can download the source code for any verified smart contract directly to your PC. It’s like catching a falling star and turning it into code. 🌟✨

## Getting Started

**Clone the Repository**: Type `git clone https://github.com/ScreamingHawk/cross-chain-verification.git`. Pray to the crypto gods that it works.

**Summon Sir Link-a-Lot**: Run `yarn install` and watch as Sir Link-a-Lot materializes in your terminal. He’ll probably complain about his unicorn’s saddle being too tight.

**Configure Your Portals**: Go to Etherscan and get your keys. Choose your source and destination chains wisely. Remember, BSC loves pancakes, and Ethereum prefers decentralized tea parties. Seriously.

**Copy-Paste Spells**: Use `yarn verify` with some arguments. Wear your wizard hat for maximum effect. If it doesn’t work, blame the alignment of the planets.

**Cosmic Code Retrieval**: Use `yarn download` to download the source code directly to your PC. If you hear faint whispers of "binary blessings", you’re on the right track.

## Contribution Guidelines

**Star-Gazers Wanted**: Report cosmic bugs. Bonus points if you describe them in rhyming couplets. Extra bonus points if you do it while riding a unicycle.

**Pull Requests from Parallel Universes**: Fork the repo, make changes, and send us a pull request. We accept PRs from alternate realities, as long as they don’t break causality. Or wind up in a time loop.

## License

This repository now operates under the GPL-3.0 Cosmic License. You’re free to fork, remix, and warp our code across the crypto-verse. Just remember to share the code like you’re passing around a cosmic brownie at an interdimensional bake sale.
